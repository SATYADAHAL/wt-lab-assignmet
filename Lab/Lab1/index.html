    <h4 id="who">Who was Nikola Tesla?</h4>
    <p>
      Nikola Tesla was an engineer and scientist known for designing the
      alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is the predominant
      electrical system used across the world today. He also created the "Tesla
      coil," which is still used in radio technology. Born in modern-day
      Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with
      Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights,
      including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse.

    <h4 id="earlylife">Early Life</h4>
    <p>
      Tesla was born in Smiljan, Croatia, on July 10, 1856. Tesla was one of
      five children, including siblings Dane, Angelina, Milka and Marica.
      Tesla's interest in electrical invention was spurred by his mother, Djuka
      Mandic, who invented small household appliances in her spare time while
      her son was growing up. Tesla's father, Milutin Tesla, was a Serbian
      orthodox priest and a writer, and he pushed for his son to join the
      priesthood. But Nikola's interests lay squarely in the sciences.

    <h4 id="edu">Education</h4>
    <p>
      After studying at the Realschule, Karlstadt (later renamed the
      Johann-Rudolph-Glauber Realschule Karlstadt) in Germany; the Polytechnic
      Institute in Graz, Austria; and the University of Prague during the 1870s,
      Tesla moved to Budapest, where for a time he worked at the Central
      Telephone Exchange. It was while in Budapest that the idea for the
      induction motor first came to Tesla, but after several years of trying to
      gain interest in his invention, at age 28 Tesla decided to leave Europe
      for America.
    </p>
    <h4 id="inventions">Inventions</h4>
    <p>
      Throughout his career, Tesla discovered, designed and developed ideas for
      a number of important inventions — most of which were officially patented
      by other inventors — including dynamos (electrical generators similar to
      batteries) and the induction motor. He was also a pioneer in the discovery
      of radar technology, X-ray technology, remote control and the rotating
      magnetic field — the basis of most AC machinery. Tesla is most well-known
      for his contributions in AC electricity and for the Tesla coil.
